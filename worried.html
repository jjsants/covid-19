				<p>
					<p class="text-worried">Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and
						through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have
						seen
						cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
						have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable
						so
						check regularly for the latest news.</p>
					<br>
					<strong>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
						precautions:</strong>
					<ul class="text-worried-ul">
						<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with
							soap and water.
							Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses
							that may be on your hands.</li>
						<li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
							sneezing.
							Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or
							mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
							including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</li>
						<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
							Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can
							transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body
							and can make you sick.</li>
						<li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means
							covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
							dispose of the used tissue immediately.
							Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people
							around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
						<li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
							medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
							Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the
							situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly
							direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
							of viruses and other infections.</li>
						<li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is
							spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older
							person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
							Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.</li>

					</ul>
					<br>
					<strong>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where
						COVID-19 is spreading</strong>
					<ul class="text-worried-ul">
						<li>Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)</li>
						<li>Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as
							headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it
							is
							essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then
							wear a
							mask to avoid infecting other people. <p>Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to
								medical facilities will allow these facilities to
								operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and
								other viruses.</p>
						</li>
						<li>If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this
							may be
							due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
							provider of
							any recent travel or contact with travelers.
							<p>Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the
								right
								health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other
								viruses.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
                    <p class="text-worried">Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone
					who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking
					after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so
					WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

					WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and
					mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks).

					The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your
					hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter
					(3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new
					coronavirus for more information.</p>
